# time-complexity-algorithms
This repository created for 3rd assignment in Data Structures &amp; Algorithms module . In here demonstrate time complexity for basic algorithms. Java is used for this work.

This repository contains code for all 4 members:
1. Linear Search - Rasika Bandara (22UG3-0234)
2. Binary Search - Nimesh Sandaruwan (22UG3-0132)
3. Bubble Sort - Pubudu Lakshan (22UG3-0282)
4. Quick Sort - JPD Hansaka (22UG3-0086)

Each file includes:
- Full algorithm implementation
- Time measurement for input sizes 100, 500, 1000
- main() method for demo
